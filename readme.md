Add your wordpress site details to the "wp_domains" table. in the file "connect.php" add data to connect to the database. in the folder "image" there must be images, and their name should be in the table "wp_posts" in the column "image" next to the content of the post you want to add. In such a way, the content automatically generated by, for example, "Chat GPT" and saved in the database, can be sent to many of your wordpress sites without involving your time.
